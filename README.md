CSS practice, making ✨aesthetic✨ websites.

## Repo Purpose
This repository contains some practice CSS/HTML single-page sites I am working on. The purpose of these is mainly for my own practice, but if you like them, you can steal them. :)

## Before You Modify
Each file has a comment at the top which explains its purpose and style. Also, CSS variables are used when possible, to make simple color and style changes easy. These are the first part within the `<style>` tag.

## License/Attribution
You are free to use the templates for your own one-page sites, but I would greatly appreciate it if you link to this repository as credit if you do so.
